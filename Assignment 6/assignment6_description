Neil Sethi- Fireworks
In this assignment I created firework in processing.  The fireworks use gravity to in order to determine how high the firework will go.  Each firework has a randomly assigned amount of gravity applied to it so some of the fireworks will explode earlier than other and some will fly off the canvas.  One of the problems I had was that I could not figure out how to stop some of the fireworks from flying out of the canvas.  When the fireworks reach a certain point they use the particle system to make the effect of them exploding.  Every time a firework is created it is set to a random color and the particle created when they explode are the same color.  This program has two classes. The Firework class makes the fireworks, adds the gravity effect, makes the explosion, displays the firework, and checks to see if the firework is valid.  The ParticleSystem function implements the particle system after the explosion and does a second test to make sure the firework is valid.  One of the things I wanted to add to this animation was add some spirals or curves to the fireworks.  Unfortunately I could not get it to work.
