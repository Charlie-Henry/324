Olympic Flag Animation - Charlie Henry
-The intended animation was the entire object translating along the X direction while the flag moves vertically up and down along the flag pole. This was accomplished with a few additional features. 
-The variable "speed" allows the flag's X and Y direction speed to be increased or changed in direction. Negative speeds correspond with leftward motion, and positive for rightward motion. 
-flagHeight is the height in which the flag will "rebound" back to the bottom. It is not the initial position on the flag. 
-The flag pShape and flagPole pShape is first created in setup() and a class AnimateFlag moves the flag in the X & Y directions. 
-Two flag objects were created and animated.
-One shortcoming was the flag does not change orientation (either left or right of the pole) when moving in their opposite directions. If the flagPole was moving to the right, we would expect the flag to be flying on the left of the flagPole. This shortcoming is due to the fact that the pShape was created before the class, and then sent to the AnimateFlag class. This makes changing the flag pShape difficult after object creation.

Bird Animation - Andrew Cheung
- The animation of the bird includes the entire bird "flying" which was done by translating horizontally. The wings of the bird are flapping/moving which was done by translating in the y-axis and also staying in line with the body of the bird.
- I used PShapes and addChild() to combine multiple shapes and create the shape of the bird.
- I used two different classes, one for the bird's body and one of the wings of the bird. The Bird class uses translate to move the bird horizontally and also resets the bird once it hits the edge of the canvas to allow the animation to continue. The wings class uses translate to allow each wing to stay in line with the bird's body as well as "flap" to add a second layer of animation.
- One of the challenges was the object-oriented part and sending the PShapes to the classes. It allowed me to familarize myself more with OO programming and get more practice with OO concepts.
