This is our final project: Bevo Basketball.
This game is a game where player A calls the other player B's shot, then Player B will attempt to make the shot by hitting the target.
The shooting of the basketball uses physical simulation and you aim with the mouse. There is a line that helps guide the shot and
the length of the line is dictates how far the shot goes.
There is multiple GUI systems with the main menu and scores and instructions.
There is also keyboard interactivity with the arrow keys to move to target, as well as keys to pause the game and mute the music.
