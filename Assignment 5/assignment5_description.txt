Neil Sethi- Sun, Moon, Earth
For this assignment I created a moon that rotates and orbits the earth and an earth that rotates and orbits a sun.  The sun also rotates.  All three rotate on the Y axis.  I got the idea for wrapping images of the sun, moon, and earth from a lesson Daniel Shiffman taught in his youtube channel.  The planet class creates the earth sphere, rotates it around the sun, rotates it along the Y axis, and calls the moon class.  The moon class creates the moon sphere, rotates it along the Y axis and revolves it around the earth sphere.  Unfortunately the way the moon orbits and the way the earth rotates it kind of looks like the moon just stays along the same point on the earth.  Trying to fix this was a challenge I faced but couldnâ€™t fix.

Andrew Cheung - Walking Dog
I created a 3D animation of a dog walking and the animations include the entire dog moving as well as the legs moving up and down to represent walking. For the dog itself, I used the built in 3D shapes of sphere and box. The body as well as the legs were made using boxes and the head was made using a sphere. The movement of the dog consisted of translations to the entire dog well as a subanimation on the legs. One challenge was to move the legs and head into the correct location which I accomplished by translating at the beginning and then incrementing for the movement.
