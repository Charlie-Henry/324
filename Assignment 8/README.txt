1. Make sure you have Processing installed on your computer.

2. We have split assignment 8 into 3 individual processing codes.
	- Part 1: CityPop
	- Part 2: BCycle OD
	- Part 3: RSS Reader

3.  Simply load each of the the .pde files into processing with the required .csv data files for parts 1 & 2 and click run. The RSS reader requires internet access.

4. For part 2: BCycle OD will run with the already supplied .CSV files. However, the python 3.6 script: bcycle_destinations.py is also supplied to show how data was organized before importing into Processing. It can be run with only importing the csv library.
